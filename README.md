### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data and Swift: Batch Updates

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

Core Data has been around for many years on OS X and it didn't take Apple long to bring it to iOS. Even though the framework doesn't get much time in the spotlight compared to other frameworks, it continues to evolve year over year. A feature that was added only recently is batch updates. Developers have been asking for this feature for many years and Apple finally found a way to integrate it into Core Data. In this tutorial, I will show you how batch updates work and what they mean for the Core Data framework.
